# DC3 Vulnhub Walkthrough

#### Description

DC-3 is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.

As with the previous DC releases, this one is designed with beginners in mind, although this time around, there is only one flag, one entry point and no clues at all.

Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.

For those with experience doing CTF and Boot2Root challenges, this probably won't take you long at all (in fact, it could take you less than 20 minutes easily).

If that's the case, and if you want it to be a bit more of a challenge, you can always redo the challenge and explore other ways of gaining root and obtaining the flag.
